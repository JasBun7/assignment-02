**Name:** Jason Zhang  
**Student Number:** 101379014  
**Course:** IMD1005A (Winter 2026)  
**Instructor:** Parthivi Rastogi  

## Client & Purpose
**NorthStar Study Club** is a student-run study group concept designed to help first-year students build consistent study habits through weekly focus sessions, goal check-ins, and shared resources. The site introduces the club, explains how it works, and includes a sign-up form.

## Pages
- **Home (index.html):** Landing page introducing the club and key benefits.
- **About (about.html):** Explains the club format, values, and what members can expect.
- **Join (contact.html):** A functional form with labels and appropriate input types.

## Design Notes
The design uses a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing across all pages. Navigation is the same on each page for a cohesive site experience.

## Technical Requirements Covered
- Semantic HTML structure (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Flexbox used for navigation and card layout
- CSS Grid used for hero layout and a multi-column information section
- External CSS only (css/styles.css) - no inline styles
- Box model demonstrated (padding/margins + box-sizing: border-box)
- Accessible form (labels with for/id, appropriate input types, submit button)
- Responsive layout using a media query

## AI Usage (Course Requirement)
I used ChatGPT to help plan page structure, improve wording, and troubleshoot layout ideas. I reviewed and edited the final code to match class concepts and to ensure I understand how it works.
